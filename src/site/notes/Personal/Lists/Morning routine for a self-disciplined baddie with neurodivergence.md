As mentioned in my [Learning self-discipline](/journal/learning-self-discipline/ "Learning self-discipline"), routines are extremely important but I have a hard time establishing it due to my mind, be it my ADHD, depression, or the lack of earth placements in my chart. So, this is my attempt to creating a routine that is  underwhelming yet rewarding. It will have sensory acts that will bring me back to my body and engage with it.

I have already concluded my [night routine](/lists/night-routine-for-a-self-disciplined-baddie-with-neurodivergence/), so here is actually setting myself up for a good day with a personalized morning routine.

1. somatic therapy for five minutes
2. play a video essay or calm music
3. brush and wash face + perform other toiletry tasks
4. do make up
5. have a light breakfast
6. create a to-do list if needed 
7. write out notes of the day (like perfume notes, but for the mood you want to set up)
8. say daily affirmations for luck and self-confidence
9. take a picture of your outfit

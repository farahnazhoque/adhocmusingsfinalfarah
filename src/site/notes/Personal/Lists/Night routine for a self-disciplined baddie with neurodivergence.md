As mentioned in my [Learning self-discipline](/journal/learning-self-discipline/ "Learning self-discipline"), routines are extremely important but I have a hard time establishing it due to my mind, be it my ADHD, depression, or the lack of earth placements in my chart. So, this is my attempt to creating a routine that is  underwhelming yet rewarding. It will have sensory acts that will bring me back to my body and engage with it.

I think one's day starts the night before, so, definitely having a good night routine will set up the mood for the rest of the day.

1. Complete school/career work by 9 PM
2. Have a bath with only candles on
3. Brush and Wash face
4. Moisturize using body butter and essential oils
5. Skin care routine
6. Pick out clothes for next day
7. Read a few pages
8. Somatic Therapy to relax
9. Apply sleep perfume
10. Be asleep by 12 AM

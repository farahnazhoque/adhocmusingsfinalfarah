## Notes and rambles:
Yanagihara is one of the best world-builders I have come across in a long while. Her exploration and in-depth descriptions of places, characters, timeline are ones that truly draws you within the story. However, it is her twists and crackdowns of the actual plot that makes you stay.

Besides her writing and storytelling, I also like how, off the bat, she makes sure we know that our narrator, whose perspective we are to follow is a very questionable and terrible human being, especially with the allegations stacked against him. It really made me uncomfortable seeing through the lens of such a despicable, and unreliable narrator.

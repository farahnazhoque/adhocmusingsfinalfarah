## Notes and rambles:
There is a lot of beautiful definitions that this book provides, that almost feel like I am receiving a hug. Your senses are always activated through the imagery it uses. There is a certain calmness that comes with reading this, almost as if I am in an old sailor moon episode. Very nostalgic, almost got me teary-eyed for my own grandmother and the kindness around me. 

If life could be curated and encapsulated within a bunch of words, I would say Kitchen is the closest thing that comes to it. Life is hard, it can be extremely cruel, but the intent of it was never to be so. I feel like us human beings make it more complicated, either for us or for others. Life is meant to be simple. it is as simple as when Mikage received a glass (check page 31) as a moving in gift. Or when Yuichi and Mikage were labelling her address cards. Nothing extraordinary, just daily, mundane tasks that bring warmth within your heart.

There is a lot of lessons to be learned from this book. Most of those lessons come in the form of resilience and perseverance after immense loss. Besides that, it teaches you to observe and learn through mundane tasks. Mikage teaches us through her cooking, through her observation of kitchens, and the women around her. The only "male" character is also deeply attuned with his feminine side, and shows us how much there is to learn from simple places, roles of mothers and grandmothers. It is how we as a society we keep on living through grief, where we find meaning.

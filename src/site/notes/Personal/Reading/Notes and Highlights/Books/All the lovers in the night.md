## Notes and rambles:
I am still collecting my thoughts on it, but right off the bat I can tell this tale is going to be one that will pay homage to my introvert self. I am an avid observer, and this book is the perfection depiction of the world through my lens.

Besides that, it is also a tale of someone who is transitioning and finally gaining courage in their thirties to live their life according to themselves and not what is expected of them.

There are a lot of discussions around spirituality, and fate. One of the characters, Hijiri, does not like to give up control. She does not believe that the Universe or any higher being exists, and those who believe them are shallow and selfish. As someone who does not like giving up control either, I had to learn the hard way that some things truly are not controllable by us individuals. Hijiri does not seem like a naive person, so, I wonder why she think in such a straight-minded way. Is it because of some sort of trauma? Is this what capitalism does to you in the end?

Lapvona, by Ottessa Moshfegh, follows the story of Marek, a thirteen-year-old boy living in the impoverished town of Lapvona. The novel delves into various facets of human nature against a backdrop of poverty, a corrupt government, and intense religious influences, including instances of religious trauma.  
  
The narrative is predominantly told through Marek’s perspective, capturing his complex relationship with his abusive father; a bond that deeply influences his equally complicated connection with God. Marek believes that God’s love is inextricably linked to suffering, a notion that highlights the overarching emotional weight of the novel.  
  
While the book features several disturbing and jarring scenes, as a result, these moments might be disturbing for some readers so please do check trigger warnings. Ultimately, Moshfegh’s writing initially drew me in and helped me overcome my reading slump, but as the story progressed, I lost interest, leading me to dnf the final 100 pages.  
  
In conclusion, while many readers have praised the novel for its bold narrative, vivid imagery, and unflinching exploration of human suffering and the complexities of faith, my own experience was a little bit mixed. Other readers have noted the novel’s power to evoke deep emotional responses and its ambitious take on themes of corruption and redemption. However, for me, the initial allure gradually gave way to a sense of disconnection, as the relentless bleakness and the need to shock the readers overshadowed its earlier promise. All in all, I wish I could get a little bit more out of it than I did.

><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-i1L18p-L.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; width: 150px; height: auto;" /> **In a village in a medieval fiefdom buffeted by natural disasters, a motherless shepherd boy finds himself the unlikely pivot of a power struggle that puts all manner of faith to a savage test, in a spellbinding novel that represents Ottessa Moshfegh’s most exciting leap yet**  
>
>Little Marek, the abused and delusional son of the village shepherd, never knew his mother; his father told him she died in childbirth. One of life’s few consolations for Marek is his enduring bond with the blind village midwife, Ina, who suckled him as a baby, as she did so many of the village’s children. Ina’s gifts extend beyond childcare: she possesses a unique ability to communicate with the natural world. Her gift often brings her the transmission of sacred knowledge on levels far beyond those available to other villagers, however religious they might be. For some people, Ina’s home in the woods outside of the village is a place to fear and to avoid, a godless place.  
>
>Among their number is Father Barnabas, the town priest and lackey for the depraved lord and governor, Villiam, whose hilltop manor contains a secret embarrassment of riches. The people’s desperate need to believe that there are powers that be who have their best interests at heart is put to a cruel test by Villiam and the priest, especially in this year of record drought and famine. But when fate brings Marek into violent proximity to the lord’s family, new and occult forces upset the old order. By year’s end, the veil between blindness and sight, life and death, the natural world and the spirit world, civility and savagery, will prove to be very thin indeed.

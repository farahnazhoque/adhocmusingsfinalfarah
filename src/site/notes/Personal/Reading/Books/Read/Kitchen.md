"Kitchen", by Banana Yoshimoto, is essentially a book about the maternal figures in our lives, the losses we encounter as we move through said life, and the power a simple yet essential space in our homes, our kitchens, has in bringing us close to our loved ones and even ourselves.

We follow our narrator, Mikage, who, grieving after her grandmother's death, finds herself living with a boy who knew her grandmother and his mother. Through them, we learn both the simple joys of life and the cruelty that is always lurking just around the corner.

There is a lot of beautiful detail that this book provides that almost felt like I was cloaked in a warm hug while reading it. All my senses were always activated by the vivid imagery that was used. There is a certain calmness that comes with reading this, almost as if I was watching an old Sailor Moon episode.

If life could be curated and encapsulated within a few thousand words, I would say "Kitchen" is the closest thing that comes to it. Life is hard; it can be extremely cruel, but the intent of it was never to be so. I feel like we human beings make it more complicated, sometimes for others and sometimes for ourselves. Life is meant to be simple. It is as simple as when Mikage received a drinking glass, but it was thoughtful; it was the most moving thing that happened to her that day. Or when Yuichi and Mikage were spending time in silence and occasional quiet exchanges as they labeled her address cards. Nothing extraordinary, but those are the moments that ground us, bring us close to the happiness we try chasing our entire lives.

"Kitchen" is filled with such beautiful, simple lessons that I needed to be reminded of. It's a wonderful and tiny book, and I highly recommend it!

Mikage, the heroine of _Kitchen_, is an orphan raised by her grandmother, who has passed away. Grieving, she is taken in by her friend Yoichi and his mother (who was once his father), Eriko. As the three of them form an improvised family that soon weathers its own tragic losses, Yoshimoto spins a lovely, evocative tale that recalls early Marguerite Duras. _Kitchen_ and its companion story, "Moonlight Shadow," are elegant tales whose seeming simplicity is the ruse of a writer whose voice echoes in the mind and the soul.

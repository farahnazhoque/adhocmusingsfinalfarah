My world is, unfortunately, looking bleak. I have given my all and done as much as possible without completely giving myself up behind my pursuit as a software engineer. I do not think it is primarily my fault that, to this date, I have not gotten a proper internship or job offer, despite what I have been made to believe for the longest time.

I have doubted myself again and again, and kept on questioning my worth as a human being, as a professional. Yet, every role I have worked within have led me to outshine and outperform, and never have I once disappointed. I am not being prideful, just giving myself the credit I so long sought from this job hunting process.

I stopped asking why I do not get jobs anymore, maybe it's luck, maybe it's the economy, maybe someone else is much more suited. Either way, I do not have a job right now, and did not get a single interview. I do not know how my entire talent and lifelong passion are being reduced to the metric of a single-page resume, and connections that no longer can or won't help, but this is where I am at right now.

It is hard looking past all my struggles. I do not know how I am staying sane amidst all this. I have faith, I have religion. That is all I have. My purpose is something I am scared I will never find, for the means to even reflect on it are not meeting. I had a lot of dreams, you know? I genuinely care for this world, and I wanted to work amongst talents and organizations that feel the same way. I just don't know if they exist anymore. Perhaps the world of tech has gone to a place I can no longer follow. 

Even if I can't, where do I go? Every time I reflect and ponder, I am left with even more questions. Questions about life, my passion, my future. So much of me still left to be uncovered but I am so afraid and so lost to even know where to go next.

I am mediocre at best, and have always been of that kind for as long as I remember. Even though, at my core I wanted to be the best, I realize now how little of an impact I really made in this world. I say all this in the context of those within my family. I was meant to be at least good, if not great. I am tired of modestly putting things, but I truly did my best, and worked the hardest. Yet, those who barely tried, those who could enjoy their freedoms, their fullest potentials, they got everything I could dream of.

It truly comes down to your self-image, and who shaped that for you. For me, it was my dad. He ruined it so much, that half the time I was trying to survive my days, be in my best behavior rather than trying to explore what could have been my true calling. I was not allowed that liberty. My dad was too busy teaching me how to be a great wife than being my own human being. He pushed me to try and be independent, but it was never truly for my own sake. It was mainly to show me off as a prize. I never received encouragement from him, just corrections and scorn.

So, yes, most of my life has been performative, and perhaps that's why I have high functioning depression. I never truly had the courage or the opportunity to showcase my most authentic self. I was never allowed to make mistakes or be a kid. I was always told to be the best or nothing. So, I am nothing now. At least that's what I was made to feel.

I am graduating tomorrow, but not a single cell within me is rejoiced. I am terrified, I am ashamed, and I wish to have died than walk down. It should be a moment of celebration, that I have achieved something. But as I did not even come Cum Laude, as I did not even graduate with honors, with such less involvement, I am reminded how I am mediocre in a mediocre university. 

Even then, it is such an important day for me, I am still graduating with a 3.8 at Computer Science and Health Informatics. I had a job, I have an internship, but even then, the first thing my father told me before even congratulating me is I should get my face and eyes done. 

And this has been the case for all my milestones. None of them felt loved or celebrated. Back then I was naive, I just thought nobody's family made a big deal. But I see my uncles now, I see my peers' fathers now, and I break down every time I see the love they get that I could not achieve even when I gave my soul away.

So, I am graduating tomorrow, and I wish I was resting atop the ocean floor instead.

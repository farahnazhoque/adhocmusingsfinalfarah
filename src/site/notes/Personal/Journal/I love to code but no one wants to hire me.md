I was in seventh grade when I decided software engineering was going to be the thing for me. When I visited my uncle and his family in Canada, I saw him on his computer all the time, while also having a really good work-life balance as a software engineer. I was already a fanatic for Barbie games, and someone who knew computer software inside out, having explored every application and tool available on the Sony VAIO.

So, for baby Farahnaz, who was in love with computers and girly games, this was a dream worth chasing. Not only will I be able to interact with and use applications I come up with, but also learn how to create them, so I can build more stuff.

I did not care about the lucrative cause; back then, SWE was not even a career people knew about. I thought I had found my calling; I thought I was different.

Fast forward to 2020, as I began applying to roles, SWE was the hottest topic, and everybody and their mom's were interested in it. Why? Because of the hiring boom thanks to COVID, the money, and the status. I did not feel great, because I knew as soon as something becomes mainstream, I no longer can exist within that space. I never did, and I still cannot. It becomes performative, it becomes toxic, it becomes a competition.

But I kept my spirits high. I did exceedingly well in classes because of how much I loved learning about CompSci, finally. But, unfortunately, that's not what college is for. And I did the whole thing wrong, apparently. I applied to internships, but I was a first-gen, and, on top of that, I had no one to guide me through it all. I did not land a single internship throughout college.

I did hackathons, I did research, I did part-time jobs, I did well in school; but most of all, I loved building projects, I loved learning, and I loved sharing my knowledge. Even if hours went by, I never left a problem unsolved. I debugged; I went to office hours. I really loved the feeling when I would finally see all my test cases pass.

I genuinely loved the role, and I know now that I would have thrived in it. I do not have the freedom to travel to places for conferences, etc.; I also want to have a life outside of my career. But, unfortunately, the field has become something I can never be part of. It is filled with people who dedicate their souls to it. I do not envy them; I just feel sorry for them.

I love CS, but I love life, too. I want to build code, but I also want to be there to build Legos with my brother. But, in a market such as ours, I do not think I can pursue a career that expects me to sell my soul.

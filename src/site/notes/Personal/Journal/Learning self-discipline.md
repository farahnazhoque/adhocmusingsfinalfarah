Blame it on my chart, blame it on my life, but ultimately, blame it on me for my lack of discipline. I have never been one to stay grounded for too long. I give off that impression for some reason, but when it comes to practice, to actually showing up for myself in that manner, I am a mess. My airiness takes away any form of attachment to the ground that we step on. So, right now, I am trying to fix that.

Some facts about me that I should put out there for context and things I need to fix, like right now:
1. I am a procrastinator
2. I avoid doing things till the last minute
3. I get distracted very easily
4. I work well under pressure but that pressure is often my own fault, and often times that well could have been so much better if I did not sabotage it myself
5. I cannot stay focused unless it is something I truly care about
6. I am always in my head, with my thoughts, never in my body or the present
7. I am responsible with my spending, but even then, I spend too much
8. I have a hard time setting boundaries for myself, my work, and others

These are some things I struggle with due to my lack of discipline and also because I am very avoidant of responsibility. It has been hard to find a way to work around these using the typical self-help kind of way. It always starts off great, but for some reason, within a week or so, my entire brain rejects it and I go back to my old self, slightly traumatized. 

Till this date, I have yet to find a method that sticks, that reinforces and wakes up my discipline muscle for once and for all. So, here is my attempt on finding this method.

I have mused about death a lot. I was no stranger to it, as I too am mortal. I have seen its reflection on my relatives, and felt its smoke suffocate those who were left to clean its mess. I was never afraid of it; I am a believer, after all. I know there is more to my story, rather, the beginning of my immortality begins after death takes me away.

To me, death was anticlimactic. It is just a condition of life. (!!SPOILER ALERT FOR YELLOWJACKETS SEASON 2!!) Yet, today, as I was listening to ["Street Spirit (Fade Out)" by Radiohead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCJblaUkkfc), and I kept replaying the scene of how Natalie was sitting on the plane with her younger self, and the juxtaposition of how she was the one who saved them all in the end from the wilderness, only to die in a moment where she was finally feeling recovering or at least trying to, really made me wonder, what is life all about?

If I were to stare at my corpse in the eye, how will I find her? Will she die of old age? Or. a freak accident? And to think there are years in the calendar where my existence does not even persist—what even is life? If I were to drop dead along the way, in which stage am I dying? The average human being passes away of old age, but how many of them have any meaning attached to their life or their death? Will my death have any value or will others be relieved of my passing? Why do I even care about others? But I should, right?

It really made me spiral as I kept imagining myself looking at my perished self as I walked to my morning discussion about theory of computation. It is very morbid and something that will put you in a trance. But it will also recenter you and prompt you to ask, what is all of this about?

I look at myself way too much in the mirror. I perform way too much for others, and when I am alone in my room, I still want to keep giving the world what is expected of me by wanting to create things that will change the world. Until recently, I was spiraling every day as I did not even know why I was pursuing software engineering anymore. All the companies I dreamt of being a part of turned out to be organizations I would hate to send my younger self into, filled with blood money and thriving on hatred.

Even now, I do not know what my purpose is in the end. But now, when I have danced along the edges of death, at least hypothetically, I wonder how much of anything truly matters in the end. Does my career and wealth take me anywhere close to the purpose I am seeking? Because if we really do dig deep, all our purposes boil down to peace and happiness. In a world where capitalism has been injected so deep into our blood, and the roles we are supposed to play in its sick and twisted theater is looking for money to solve our problems, and with the way this society is set up, I would say it kind of is. If you do not chase that wealth, you have nothing.

But in the end, I am again left to wonder, and stay put in this extremely uncomfortable and uncertain state where every step I take feels forced due to what is expected of me, what is safe. In such dire circumstances, where death is the only promised ending for me, I have deduced that I needed to look in the mundane and find extraordinaries within it. It is no novel advice to find joy in your daily life, but as someone who is always in pursuit of greatness, I did often overlook my day-to-day life, allowing them to be more like filled episodes than things to look forward to.

When I imagined my lifeless form, I did not imagine my current self; I imagined someone older. But it all changes when I imagine someone closer to my age. It means I might end up six feet under before I even become the great I wish to be. Definitely not giving up on that pursuit, but also reminding myself that the pursuit is not one defined state; it can be multiple, and might even look vastly different for me in my 30s than it does now in my 20s. So, all I really do have right now is my current self, my current tools and circumstances, and I try to produce happiness from them, instead of treating today as just a stepping stone for a tomorrow that perhaps does not even exist.

So today, I am letting go of that control I so craved for a certain future. I will try now to make happiness, weave it from within me instead of trying to collect scraps of threads from companies and wealth that have inadvertently forced me to be unkind to myself and to the world around me, treating everyone and everything as competition. The only thing I can control is the love I give from within me, in hopes it reaches someone and myself. Community, knowledge, kindness—I have shoved those way too far; so now I am in pursuit of the love I have shunned for way too long.

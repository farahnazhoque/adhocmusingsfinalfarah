Pain is an entity that we carry within ourselves. It is invisible, yet its weight takes away souls, hopefully to a better place, but away from their lives forever. It has so much power, yet we can conceal it so easily. We can never be free from it, because we are conscious beings, we are beings who understand. Deer do not hate a lion for eating one from their herd, but we do. They grieve, but they do not carry it forever. They accept it for what it is, but humans do carry it, subconsciously at times. Does it make us better or worse than beings who do not fathom the cruelties of life?

The grief I carry, my grief, is perhaps a cage I built myself to be locked up within. The outside world is dark, dangerous, and too real. Too real for me to navigate through. Too real to make my stomach drop if I keep wandering about.

So, I took the hurt I received. Made it bigger than it is meant to be, so I can cry and complain about it, acting as if I wasn't the one who built this brick by brick to keep reality away from consuming me. 

Now I close my eyes. Unwilling to see the person in front of me, whom I love and trust one day, but beg them silently to love me again the next, then resent them for the rest of the week. I hate them with so much passion, but I feel grief for them just as much as they are too left alone and betrayed again. 

I should not have been born with such understanding. I should have been born a fool, a person void of emotion and empathy. It cuts me, scars me every time I try to be understanding, but those are the building blocks I need to keep me in my cage of grief. I keep coming back for more for facing the person might push me to the world I am too scared to face.

There my cage won't keep out the demons. There my cage won't be my excuse.

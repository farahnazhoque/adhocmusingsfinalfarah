Being in a stressful environment really does take away your creativity. Creativity comes to me best when I am most free, most liberated. It flows through me as if peace itself has descended from the heavens to help me be my authentic self and be ok with it. However, whenever I am put in an environment or space where I am constantly in fight or flight mode, I feel the creative soul within me scurry away in a place I no longer can reach or have access to. Itâ€™s like a child afraid.

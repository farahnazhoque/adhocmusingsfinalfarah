There is something so liberating when you finally figure out your personal style. For the longest time, I was moving with trends, trying to fit in, all the while feeling wrong and out of place even more. However, after slowing down, seeing fashion trends for what they areâ€”a cog in a problematic machine that pulls you into places you would not have otherwise ventured (aka trad wives to conservative pipeline), I have finally found one that has somehow always been there, but I never looked at it. It was thanks to finally creating visions instead of consuming that I found that, for this particular style, I was inspired by my mother, culture, music taste, aesthetics I have always been drawn to, movies, and personality. I encourage everyone to tap into their inner voice, intuition, to find their way to style. Take inspiration from the world around you, not a machine-made algorithm.

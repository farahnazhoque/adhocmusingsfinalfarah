I often wonder why I am so hesitant to do tasks and work when there is no one to validate or monitor my progress? I do not like to deem myself as being lazy, because I do love to do a lot of things, like styling outfits, reading, writing, and programming. However, even for all those things, I am often very reluctant to do them if I know no one is going to be there to observe me.

It’s almost as if, if no one is there to watch me, I merely do not exist in those spaces and times. I realize how worrisome this is for someone like me, someone who spends a lot of time by herself in her room. To me, such a deduction makes me feel like I exist within a void. I do not like to call attention to myself, at least that’s what I like to think; but in the end, me saying that makes me want a different kind of attention—the attention of being different.

I have come to realize: I, too, have been sucked up into the world of performative existence. How can I not? We live in a world where we stare at our tiny screens more than the sky that is omnipresent over us. We fail to appreciate the people and their work around us because we are busy applauding and writing fake hurrahs for those on LinkedIn. So, everything we do now is to curate and portray in a certain type of way on social media. Everything has become performative because that’s what we are left with in this digital age.

I wonder what freedom tastes like. It taunts me every time sunlight shines upon it. My freedom is in a glass jar. Its color is that of raw honey. I stare at it longingly, as seconds turn to minutes, hours, days, months, and years. The glass of the jar is made of shame and disgrace. If I break it, will I be free? I put my finger in it once in a while, when I go out in the world by myself. But every time I wish to speak, to lick the tip of my finger and let it seep through my porous tongue, I can only feel the shards that promise to scatter if I let it sit in my mouth for too long.

I heard somewhere that the best thing a woman can do is be shameless. In a world where we are constantly shamed for everything, the good, the bad, the innocent, the evil, shamelessness will free you. I was so na√Øve to have thought I was free from the lens of men. But with the shards scraping my tongue, the ones I am too scared to swallow, I realize I, too, am stuck in this hellish gaze. I, too, am performing. I, too, am acting according to what these men expect of me. I, too, am being what I detest the most.

So, for now, I close the jar. Hopefully some day, I can teach myself to consume the nectar of freedom and taste it for what it is, and not the glass of shame that it is kept within.

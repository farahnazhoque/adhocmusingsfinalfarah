Yellowjackets, being a girl

I recently concluded watching Yellowjackets (at least all the released seasons), and it really took me back to what it was like being a girl in a makeshift small town, where hierarchies and roles had been set out for us as soon as we had turned twelve.

Being a girl is complicated. Being a girl surrounded by other girls even more so. To this day, I will die on this hill saying that teenage girls are some of the most complex species to have ever roamed this earth. I am not saying that as you grow older your complexities gets watered down or anything, but I think at least, when you are an adult, you do gain some maturity and self-awareness that makes you act more in a level-headed manner.

However, being a teenage girl is a completely different ballgame. To me, at least it felt like experiencing every event on a heightened and molecular level. It was confusing, scary, and definitely involved a lot of politics. To this date, I flinch whenever I hear or look at some of my "bullies" (I do not like to categorize them to such an aggressive term, but I do not know how else to describe them). However, today I am taking the time to truly understand them, and give them the grace they deserve.

Some context about my school experience: I grew up in Bangladesh, and got all of my education there till college. The thing about Bangladesh's schools are, especially the English-medium schools were that if you enroll under one english-meidum school, they will cater to you from Playgroup till twelfth grade, meaning from when you are three-years-old to when you are eighteen or nineteen. Sixteen years of your life basically goes spending with the same people. So, you can imagine how complicated relationships became. 

Now with that out of the way, I want to provide some context about the girls who basically ran the school, and what kind of people they were, and how, this had began to shape my relationships with others of similar cadence. Those girls were light-skinned, with pin-straight hair that was brown or the lightest of black. They were dainty, they had freedom, they knew seniors, they laughed the right way, they made you feel like the best and the smallest. They laughed behind your back, they laughed behind each other's back, but it was cool. You would be in the same room, and they will talk about you using vile nicknames. They will stand up for you against their boyfriends, but when you leave, they will fuel the fire even more. They will let you cry on their shoulders, but eavesdrop and pry for every detail, and tomorrow you will hear about it from someone else. They will cover your period-stained kameez, but leave you waiting in the dark at coaching centers. They will talk about their crushes, ask you abour yours, and then you catch them twirling their hair for the crush you mentioned. 

I wonder why? You don't see teenage boys do that. They are so one dimensional and just kids, whereas girls were running empires, waging wars. Is it because we are mature? Is it because we are forced to mature? 

Being a south asian girl growing up in a south asian country really messes up your sense of self. None of these girl became like so from the moment they came to this world. The people around them conditioned them again and again to that point. Male validation, the need to breakfree from societal expectation, the need to be liked by others, the purpose of yourself. Girls in south asia at least are always reminded to think more for others than for themselves. They are always asked to get the best thing, and those are always tied to men. Marry the richest man, be skinny to appeal to men, be pretty to appeal to men, take care of your hair and skin for men. Give me a break.
